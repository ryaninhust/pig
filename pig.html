<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>In this project, you will develop a simulator and strategy function for the game of
Pig. You will need to implement some higher-order functions, experiment with random
number generators, and generate some ASCII art. This project uses ideas from
Chapter 1 of the lecture notes.</p>

<p>Pig is a dice game with simple rules: Two players race to reach 100 total points.
Each turn, a player repeatedly <i>rolls</i> a die until either a 1 ("pig") is rolled or
the player <i>holds</i> and scores the sum of the rolls.  The sum of the rolls
on a turn is called the <i>turn total</i>. At any time during a player's turn,
the player is faced with two decisions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>roll</b> - If the player rolls a</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>1: the player scores 1 point and it becomes the opponent's
        turn.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>anything else: the roll is added to the player's turn total, and
        the turn continues.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><b>hold</b> - The player scores the turn total and it becomes the opponent's
    turn.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Someone has posted a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVIvB-ahI4A">Pig
instructional video</a>.  Our rules differ somewhat from those in the video:
they give 0 points to a turn that ends in a
roll of 1, while we give 1 point.  

<p>In this project, you will create a variant of Pig that uses two different
dice.  Players roll a 6-sided die, unless the <i>sum of the scores</i> of both
players is a multiple of 7 (0 included), in which case they roll a 4-sided die.
This sum of scores <i>does not</i> include the turn total.</p>

<p>This project includes three files, but all of your changes will be made to the first
one. You can download all of the project code as a <a href="pig.zip">zip
archive</a>.</p>

<h3>Logistics</h3>

<p>This is a two-week project.
Start early! The amount of time it takes to complete a project (or any
program) is unpredictable. Ask for help early and often -- the TAs and lab
assistants are here to help.</p>

<p> The project is worth 15 points.  To avoid fractions, however, we
have assigned "inflated" points that add up to 25.  We'll simply
weight the grading calculation by multiplying the nominal score you
receive by 0.6.

<p>The only file that you are required to submit is the file called "pig.py".
You do not need to modify any other files in order to complete the project. To
submit the project, change to the directory where the pig.py file is located and
run <code>submit proj1</code>. We will set up an autograder that runs your
code through different test cases and sends out the results in an email.<p>

<h3>Phase 1</h3>

<p>In the first week, you will develop a simulator for the game and a basic strategy.
The first step in implementing a Pig simulator is to specify the rules of the game.
You will implement two of the legal actions: <code>roll</code> and
<code>hold</code>. A turn consists of a
sequence of actions and ends either when a player rolls a 1 or holds.
Read the comments
of the functions you are implementing, as they specify the precise behavior
expected.</p>

<p><b>Problem A1</b> (1 pt). Implement the <code>roll</code> function in
<code><a href="pig.py.html">pig.py</a></code>, which computes the result of rolling a particular outcome.
No points are scored unless the turn ends! On successful (greater than 1)
rolls, points are only accumulated in the turn total.</p>

<p>Verify your work by checking that the doctest for <code>roll</code> passes when you
run</p>
<pre>
python3 -m doctest pig.py
</pre>

<p><b>Problem B1</b> (1 pt). Implement the <code>hold</code> function in
<code><a href="pig.py.html">pig.py</a></code>, which computes the result of holding. Holding actually doesn't
care about the dice outcome. Nonetheless, this argument is provided so that
<code>hold</code> has the same signature as <code>roll</code>. Similarly,
<code>hold</code> must return a turn total even though the result is irrelevant
to the game. Always return a turn total of 0.</p>

<p>Verify your work by checking that the doctest for <code>hold</code> passes when you
run</p>
<pre>
python3 -m doctest pig.py
</pre>

<p><b>Problem 2</b> (2 pt). Implement the <code>take_turn</code> function, which
simulates a complete turn that may include multiple rolls. This function takes a
<code>plan</code> argument, which itself is a function (see next paragraph). The
return value of <code>take_turn</code> is the total number of points the player
scored during that turn.

<p>A <i>plan</i> is a function that takes one integer argument, the current
<code>turn_total</code>, and returns one of the two legal actions: either
<code>roll</code> or <code>hold</code> that you just implemented. A plan
represents a player's decision of whether to roll or hold.  It does not consider
the total score for either player; only the current turn total.</p>

<p>A <i>dice</i> is also a function (we would call it a "die", but that's too
morbid).  It takes no arguments and returns an integer: the outcome of a die
roll.

<p><i>Important:</i> Your implementation of <code>take_turn</code> should call
the <code>dice</code> function <i>exactly once</i> for every action, including
<code>hold</code>. If you don't do this, various tests will break later in the
project!</p>

<p>For now, you can ignore the arguments <code>who</code>, and
<code>comments</code>, which you will use later.</p>

<p>The <code>run</code> function at the bottom of <code><a href="pig.py.html">pig.py</a></code> is currently set
up to call <code>take_turn</code> (via <code>take_turn_test</code>) and print the
result. Hence, you can experiment with your implementation simply by running</p>
<pre>
python3 pig.py
</pre>

<p>The plan that is provided by default will <code>roll</code> until the turn
total reaches at least 10, and then <code>hold</code>.</p>

<p><i>Hint:</i> We have provided some tools in <code><a href="ucb.py.html">ucb.py</a></code> to help you
understand what is happening in your code. If you decorate a function with
<code>@trace</code>, then a line of output will be printed every time that function is
called. If you call <code>log_current_line()</code>, then the current line number will
be printed. Finally, if you call <code>interact()</code>, then you will receive an
interactive prompt in the current environment.</p>

<p><b>Problem 3</b> (1 pt). Implement a better <code>take_turn_test</code>, which
validates the correctness of your <code>take_turn</code> implementation. To do so, read
the <code><a href="dice.py.html">dice.py</a></code> file, which provides a function called
<code>make_test_die</code>. Test dice are not random like regular dice. Instead, you
can specify the exact sequence of outcomes returned by successive rolls. The docstring
for <code>make_test_die</code> shows examples.</p>

<p>Using <code>assert</code> statements, test that the default plan scores exactly 10
points when rolling a 4, 6, 1. Add additional tests to ensure that the plan gives
expected outcomes with various roll sequences.</p>

<p><b>Problem 4</b> (1 pt). Change the default value for <code>comments</code> in
<code>take_turn</code> from <code>False</code> to <code>True</code>. Then, call
<code>commentate</code> after the result of each action is computed, whenever
<code>comment</code> is <code>True</code>. You will need to read the docstring
for <code>commentate</code> to make this call correctly.</p>

<p>After you start calling the <code>commentate</code> function, you should see a
transcript of events when you run <code><a href="pig.py.html">pig.py</a></code> that includes statements like,
"Someone did something... Someone now has a turn total of 7 points." Details of
the game events are currently rather vague.</p>

<p><b>Problem A5</b> (2 pt). Now  implement
<code>describe_action</code>, which takes an action function and returns a
string describing that action. Edit the body of <code>describe_action</code> so
that its doctest passes.  For any action that is not <code>roll</code> or
<code>hold</code>, the commentator should announce that an illegal action was
taken.</p> 

<p>When you are finished, the doctest for <code>describe_action</code> should pass, and
your commentary should have informative action messages when you run
<code>take_turn</code> with <code>comments</code> equal to <code>True</code>.</p>

<p><i>Hint:</i> You can figure out what a function is without calling it, using
<code>==</code>.

<p><b>Problem B5</b> (2 pt). Implement <code>draw_number</code>,
which draws the outcome of a die using text symbols. Such pictures are called
ASCII art.</p>

<p>The drawing facility is actually written for you in <code>draw_die</code>. However,
it uses a bunch of Python syntax that we haven't yet covered! You'll have to use this
function as a black box, just by reading its docstring. Programming often involves
using other people's code by reading the documentation.</p>

<p>When you are finished, the doctest for <code>draw_number</code> should pass, and
your commentary should produce ASCII dice pictures when you call
<code>take_turn</code> with <code>comments</code> equal to
<code>True</code>.</p>

<p>You're almost ready to implement a full game of Pig!

<p><b>Problem 6</b> (1 pt). First, implement <code>make_roll_until_strategy</code>.
This is a function that returns a <i>strategy</i>. Strategies are functions that return
plans. Plans are functions that return actions. Actions are functions too.
Yikes! This project just got complicated. Fortunately, our functional
abstractions will alleviate us from ever having to write quadruple-nested
<code>def</code> statements. In fact, this question requires very little code,
but lots of description.</p>

<p><i>Plans:</i> A plan is a function that takes one integer argument,
the current <code>turn_total</code>, and returns an action (<code>hold</code> or
<code>roll</code>). We have already been using plans to test
<code>take_turn</code>. In <code>take_turn_test</code>, we created a plan using
the <code>make_roll_until_plan</code> function, which takes a
<code>turn_goal</code> and returns a plan to roll until that goal is met. Go
read the implementation of <code>make_roll_until_plan</code>. Your strategy
functions will use it.</p>

<p><i>Strategies:</i> A strategy is a function that takes two arguments: the player's
score and the opponent's score. It returns a plan. A strategy is used to pick a plan
each turn, based on the players' current scores in the game.</p>

<p> <code>make_roll_until_strategy</code> itself is not the strategy, but a
function that returns a strategy.</p>

<p>Your implementation of <code>make_roll_until_strategy</code> should return a
<i>very</i> simple strategy: one that always returns the same plan regardless of
its two arguments. The plan it returns always chooses to roll unless the
specified turn_total goal has been reached.</p>

<p>Call <code>make_roll_until_strategy_test</code> to verify your work.</p>

<p><b>Problem 7</b> (3 pt). Finally, implement the <code>play</code> function, which
simulates a full game of pig. Players alternate turns, each using the plan returned by
their own strategy function, until one of the players reaches the goal score. When the
game ends, <code>play</code> should return 0 if the first player wins and 1
otherwise.</p>

<p>Remember that you must supply the correct die to the <code>take_turn</code>
function, according to the rules stated at the beginning of the project. As you work,
remember to add <code>print</code> statements and use <code>@trace</code> to see what
is happening in your code.</p>

<p>To test your implementation, follow the instructions in the <code>run</code>
function at the bottom of the project to play an interactive game.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You've finished phase 1 of this project!</p>

<h3>Phase 2</h3>

<p>In the second week, you will experiment with ways to improve upon the basic
strategy. In order to do this, you will first implement a small framework for testing
strategy functions against the roll-until strategy. We will use the strategy returned
by <code>make_roll_until_strategy(20)</code> as a baseline upon which we hope to
improve.</p>

<i>Note:</i> You will want to set the default of <code>comment</code> back to
<code>False</code> in the definition of <code>take_turn</code>, so that you're
not overwhelmed with output.

<p><b>Problem 8</b> (1 pt). Implement the <code>average_value</code> function. This
function takes two arguments, a non-pure target function <code>fn</code> and an integer
<code>num_samples</code> that indicates how many times the target function should be
called. The return value of the target function should be a number. Call
<code>fn</code> repeatedly, <code>num_sample</code> times, and return the average
result. Assume that <code>fn</code> takes no arguments. Make sure that the doctest
passes before you move on.</p>

<p><b>Problem 9</b> (2 pt). Implement the <code>averaged</code> function. This
higher-order function takes a function <code>fn</code> as argument, and creates another
function that takes the same number of arguments as the original. It is different from
the original in that it returns the average value of repeatedly calling <code>fn</code>
on its arguments.</p>

<p>To implement this function, you need a new piece of Python syntax! You must write a
function that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments, then calls another function
using exactly those arguments. Here's how it works.</p>

<p>Instead of listing formal parameters for a function, we write <code>*args</code>. To
call another function using exactly those arguments, we call it again with
<code>*args</code>. <code>args</code> is actually just another name in the
environment, but changing that name is unconventional. For example,</p>
<pre >
&gt;&gt;&gt; def printed(fn):
      def print_and_return(*args):
          result = fn(*args)
          print('Result:', result)
          return result
      return print_and_return

&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_pow = printed(pow)
&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_pow(2, 8)
Result: 256
256
</pre>

<p>Read the docstring for <code>averaged</code> carefully to understand how it is meant
to work. Your implementation can use the <code>average_value</code> function you
already implemented, but this is not required.</p>

<p><b>Problem 10</b> (2 pt). This problem is about understanding code. Read
<code>compare_strategies</code> and <code>eval_strategy_range</code>.
Then, in <code>run_strategy_experiments</code>, use
<code>eval_strategy_range</code> to evaluate different roll-until strategies, for
<code>turn_goal</code> values from 15 to 25 inclusive. Print out what
<code>eval_strategy_range</code> determined was the best value.</p>

<p>Now you will implement three strategies that improve upon the baseline. 
Some of the experiments may take up to a minute to
run. You can always reduce the number of random samples in <code>averaged</code>
to speed up experiments.</p>

<p><b>Problem 11A</b> (2 pt). Implement the <code>make_die_specific_strategy</code>
function. This function takes two turn goals, <code>four_side_goal</code> and
<code>six_side_goal</code>, and returns a new strategy that checks to see which die is
being used (either 4-sided or 6-sided) and returns a roll-until plan that stops at
the corresponding turn goal. Keep in mind that a four-sided die is only used when the
sum of your score and your opponent's score is divisible by 7. The idea here is that
holding early with a 4-sided die avoids 1's.</p>

<p>Add an experiment to <code>run_strategy_experiments</code> that evaluates different
turn goals for a 4-sided die, in the range 5 to 15.</p>

<p><b>Problem 11B</b> (2 pt). Implement the <code>make_pride_strategy</code>, which
only stops rolling when two conditions are true: the turn total is at least
<code>turn_goal</code> and the player's score after holding is at least
<code>margin</code> greater than the opponent. The idea here is that riskier rolling is
justified when a player is behind.</p>

<p>Add an experiment to <code>run_strategy_experiments</code> that evaluates different
margins for your new strategy, in the range 0 to 10.</p>

<p><b>Problem 12</b> (2 pt). Implement <code>final_strategy</code>, which combines
these ideas and others to achieve a win rate of at least 0.60 against the baseline
roll-until-20 strategy. Here are some hints:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Think about what happens when you only need 10 more points to win, but are using
  a roll-until-20 strategy. Can you improve end-game performance?</li>

  <li>Roll-until-20 is a very bad idea when given a 4-sided die. Can you give your
  opponent more bad dice?</li>
</ul>

<p>You're implementing a strategy function directly here, as opposed to a function that
returns a strategy. If your win rate is usually (i.e., half the time) above 0.60, you
have answered the question successfully.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you've reached the end of your first CS61A project!</p>
